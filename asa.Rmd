## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

train = read.csv("trainingData.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)
train = train[-c(1,2)]
#For event column, set NA values to "No Event"
train$Events <- replace(train$Events, is.na(train$Events), "No Event")
table(train$Events)

#Add a column that counts the number of NAs in the data
train$CountNA <- apply(train, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) length(x[is.na(x)]) )
table(train$CountNA)

# We probably want to remove rows with more than 8 missing values. Let's check what these rows look like
bigMissing <- train[train$CountNA > 8,] # Looks like none of these rows have any rare events so they should be safe to delete
#I will go ahead and delete these cases
train <- train[train$CountNA < 9,]

#Now I will check the values with only 1 NA because there are a lot of them
#smallMissing <- train[train$CountNA == 1,]

#Check correlation between variables
numericTrain <- train[complete.cases(train),sapply(train, is.numeric)]
m <- cor(numericTrain)
corrplot::corrplot(m)
names(train)
#Gustspeed seems to be correlated with mean sea level pressure and mean windspeed
gustModel <- lm(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH~train$Mean_Sea_Level_PressureIn+train$Mean_Wind_SpeedMPH)
#Also make model with interaction term
gustModel2 <- lm(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH~train$Mean_Sea_Level_PressureIn+
                   train$Mean_Wind_SpeedMPH + 
                   train$Mean_Sea_Level_PressureIn*train$Mean_Wind_SpeedMPH )
gustModel3 <- lm(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH~train$Mean_Sea_Level_PressureIn )
gustModel4 <- lm(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH~ train$Mean_Wind_SpeedMPH)
summary(gustModel)
summary(gustModel2) # Interaction term is not significant, should go with original model
summary(gustModel3)
summary(gustModel4)

plot(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH) #ok, hust speeds should be between 0 and 100
#Impute max gust speed based on sea level and wind speed linear regression model
train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH <- ifelse(is.na(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH), 
                                  coefficients(gustModel4)[1] + (coefficients(gustModel4)[2]*train$Mean_Wind_SpeedMPH), 
                                  train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH) 
plot(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH) #Looks good
summary(train$Max_Gust_SpeedMPH) # there are a couple of really big values, but should be ok
###############
#Let's see is there any difference between 
missingdata = train[train$CountNA != 0,]
Missing1<- train[train$CountNA == 1,]#only Cloudcover missing since 2 is no events, and one is FOG
Missing2 <- train[train$CountNA == 2,]#MIn&Max VIsibility Miles/ events rain/ 
missing3=train[train$CountNA == 3,]#Min_Sea_Level_PressureIn Max_VisibilityMiles Mean_VisibilityMiles Min_VisibilityMiles// no events
Missing4 <- train[train$CountNA == 4,]
Missing7<- train[train$CountNA == 7,]


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#cleaning the data, imputation occurs for this task
#impute the estimated value in those "NA" except those rows with "No Event"

#try to find out the rows which have more than 1 NA and are not "No Event"
trainmissing <- train[train$CountNA > 1 & train$Events != "No Event", ] #1 for snowthunderstorm, 1 for rain

#check if there is "Snow-Thunderstorm" event for other rows
snowThundersStorms <- train[train$Events == "Snow-Thunderstorm" & train$CountNA > 1,] 

#form an environment that only has event "Rain" with number of less than or equal to 1 "NA"
trainRain <- train[train$Events == "Rain" & train$CountNA ==1,]


```
